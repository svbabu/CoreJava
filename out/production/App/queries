1)query for list of salaries of  maneger wise?
select name,job, salary from employee inner join dept on employee.did=dept.did where job='manager';
      name           job         salary
 o/p)bhargav	    manager	    500000
     sharama	    manager	    600000
     tangalakshmi	manager	    200000
     vara	        manager	    700000

2) query per fetch slary from specific manager name wise (ex:vara is manager name)?
select name,job, salary from employee inner join dept on employee.did=dept.did where job='manager' And name='vara';

3)find the highest salary from list of employees?
select name,job,salary from employee inner join dept on employee.did=dept.did where salary in(select max(salary)from employee);

o/p)   name  job     salary
      vara	manager	700000

4)find the 2 highest salary from list of employees from manager wise?

select emp1.*,de.job from employee emp1 inner join dept de  on 2-1=(select count(distinct(emp2.salary)) from employee emp2 where emp2.salary>emp1.salary And job='manager');

o/p) eid   name     salary  did  job
     5	  sharama	600000	112	manager
5) suppose if we find second hihest salry from employee as developer then give job='developer' instead of manager  

note)Refer to above query  as just change job='developer' thats it.
note similarlly 3rd hihest and 4h and nth hihest salary  refere to above query .
